Interact with Solana nodes directly with the JSON RPC API via the HTTP and
Websocket methods.

## Configuring State Commitment

For preflight checks and transaction processing, Solana nodes choose which bank
state to query based on a commitment requirement set by the client. The
commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. When
querying the ledger state, it's recommended to use lower levels of commitment to
report progress and higher levels to ensure the state will not be rolled back.

In descending order of commitment (most finalized to least finalized), clients
may specify:

- `finalized` - the node will query the most recent block confirmed by
  supermajority of the cluster as having reached maximum lockout, meaning the
  cluster has recognized this block as finalized
- `confirmed` - the node will query the most recent block that has been voted on
  by supermajority of the cluster.
  - It incorporates votes from gossip and replay.
  - It does not count votes on descendants of a block, only direct votes on that
    block.
  - This confirmation level also upholds "optimistic confirmation" guarantees in
    release 1.3 and onwards.
- `processed` - the node will query its most recent block. Note that the block
  may still be skipped by the cluster.

For processing many dependent transactions in series, it's recommended to use
`confirmed` commitment, which balances speed with rollback safety. For total
safety, it's recommended to use `finalized` commitment.

### Default Commitment

If commitment configuration is not provided, the node will
[default to `finalized` commitment](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/aa0922d6845e119ba466f88497e8209d1c82febc/sdk/src/commitment_config.rs#L199-L203)

Only methods that query bank state accept the commitment parameter. They are
indicated in the API Reference below.

## RpcResponse Structure

Many methods that take a commitment parameter return an RpcResponse JSON object
comprised of two parts:

- `context` : An RpcResponseContext JSON structure including a `slot` field at
  which the operation was evaluated.
- `value` : The value returned by the operation itself.

## Parsed Responses

Some methods support an `encoding` parameter, and can return account or
instruction data in parsed JSON format if `"encoding":"jsonParsed"` is requested
and the node has a parser for the owning program. Solana nodes currently support
JSON parsing for the following native and SPL programs:

| Program                      | Account State | Instructions |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Address Lookup               | v1.15.0       | v1.15.0      |
| BPF Loader                   | n/a           | stable       |
| BPF Upgradeable Loader       | stable        | stable       |
| Config                       | stable        |              |
| SPL Associated Token Account | n/a           | stable       |
| SPL Memo                     | n/a           | stable       |
| SPL Token                    | stable        | stable       |
| SPL Token 2022               | stable        | stable       |
| Stake                        | stable        | stable       |
| Vote                         | stable        | stable       |

The list of account parsers can be found
[here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/account-decoder/src/parse_account_data.rs),
and instruction parsers
[here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/transaction-status/src/parse_instruction.rs).

## Filter criteria

Some methods support providing a `filters` object to enable pre-filtering the
data returned within the RpcResponse JSON object. The following filters exist:

- `memcmp: object` - compares a provided series of bytes with program account
  data at a particular offset. Fields:

  - `offset: usize` - offset into program account data to start comparison
  - `bytes: string` - data to match, as encoded string
  - `encoding: string` - encoding for filter `bytes` data, either "base58" or
    "base64". Data is limited in size to 128 or fewer decoded bytes.<br />
    **NEW: This field, and base64 support generally, is only available in
    solana-core v1.14.0 or newer. Please omit when querying nodes on earlier
    versions**

- `dataSize: u64` - compares the program account data length with the provided
  data size

title: Data Structures as JSON
hideTableOfContents: false
h1: Common JSON Data Structures for Solana RPC Methods
---

Various Solana RPC methods will return more complex responses as structured JSON
objects, filled with specific keyed values.

The most common of these JSON data structures include:

- [transactions](#transactions)
- [inner instructions](#inner-instructions)
- [token balances](#token-balances)

## Transactions

Transactions are quite different from those on other blockchains. Be sure to
review [Anatomy of a Transaction](/docs/core/transactions) to learn about
transactions on Solana.

### JSON

The JSON structure of a transaction is defined as follows:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Reference">

  ]
}
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

- `message: <object>` - Defines the content of the transaction.
  - `accountKeys: <array[string]>` - List of base-58 encoded public keys used by
    the transaction, including by the instructions and for signatures. The first
    `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` public keys must sign the
    transaction.
  - `header: <object>` - Details the account types and signatures required by
    the transaction.
    - `numRequiredSignatures: <number>` - The total number of signatures
      required to make the transaction valid. The signatures must match the
      first `numRequiredSignatures` of `message.accountKeys`.
    - `numReadonlySignedAccounts: <number>` - The last
      `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the signed keys are read-only accounts.
      Programs may process multiple transactions that load read-only accounts
      within a single PoH entry, but are not permitted to credit or debit
      lamports or modify account data. Transactions targeting the same
      read-write account are evaluated sequentially.
    - `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts: <number>` - The last
      `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts` of the unsigned keys are read-only accounts.
  - `recentBlockhash: <string>` - A base-58 encoded hash of a recent block in
    the ledger used to prevent transaction duplication and to give transactions
    lifetimes.
  - `instructions: <array[object]>` - List of program instructions that will be
    executed in sequence and committed in one atomic transaction if all succeed.
    - `programIdIndex: <number>` - Index into the `message.accountKeys` array
      indicating the program account that executes this instruction.
    - `accounts: <array[number]>` - List of ordered indices into the
      `message.accountKeys` array indicating which accounts to pass to the
      program.
    - `data: <string>` - The program input data encoded in a base-58 string.
  - `addressTableLookups: <array[object]|undefined>` - List of address table
    lookups used by a transaction to dynamically load addresses from on-chain
    address lookup tables. Undefined if `maxSupportedTransactionVersion` is not
    set.
    - `accountKey: <string>` - base-58 encoded public key for an address lookup
      table account.
    - `writableIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load
      addresses of writable accounts from a lookup table.
    - `readonlyIndexes: <array[number]>` - List of indices used to load
      addresses of readonly accounts from a lookup table.
- `signatures: <array[string]>` - A list of base-58 encoded signatures applied
  to the transaction. The list is always of length
  `message.header.numRequiredSignatures` and not empty. The signature at index
  `i` corresponds to the public key at index `i` in `message.accountKeys`. The
  first one is used as the
  [transaction id](/docs/references/terminology#transaction-id).

### JSON Parsed

The JSON parsed structure of a transaction follows a similar structure to the
regular JSON format, with additional parsing of account and instruction
information:

  - `amount: <string>` - Raw amount of tokens as a string, ignoring decimals.
  - `decimals: <number>` - Number of decimals configured for token's mint.
  - `uiAmount: <number|null>` - Token amount as a float, accounting for
    decimals. **DEPRECATED**

title: HTTP Methods
seoTitle: Solana RPC HTTP Methods
hideTableOfContents: false
h1: Solana RPC HTTP Methods
---

Solana nodes accept HTTP requests using the
[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification.

> For JavaScript applications, use the
> [@solana/web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) library as a
> convenient interface for the RPC methods to interact with a Solana node. For
> an PubSub connection to a Solana node, use the
> [Websocket API](/docs/rpc/websocket/).

## RPC HTTP Endpoint

Default port: `8899`

- http://localhost:8899
- http://192.168.1.88:8899

## Request Formatting

To make a JSON-RPC request, send an HTTP POST request with a
`Content-Type: application/json` header. The JSON request data should contain 4
fields:

- `jsonrpc: <string>` - set to `"2.0"`
- `id: <string | number | null>` - a unique identifier for the request,
  generated by the client. Typically a string or number, though null is
  technically allowed but not advised
- `method: <string>` - a string containing the method to be invoked
- `params: <array>` - a JSON array of ordered parameter values

Example using curl:

```shell
curl https://api.devnet.solana.com -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBalance",
    "params": [
      "83astBRguLMdt2h5U1Tpdq5tjFoJ6noeGwaY3mDLVcri"
    ]
  }
'
```

The response output will be a JSON object with the following fields:

- `jsonrpc: <string>` - matching the request specification
- `id: <number>` - matching the request identifier
- `result: <array|number|object|string>` - requested data or success
  confirmation

Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects
as the data for a single POST.

### Example Request

The commitment parameter should be included as the last element in the `params`
array:

```shell
curl https://api.devnet.solana.com -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBalance",
    "params": [
      "83astBRguLMdt2h5U1Tpdq5tjFoJ6noeGwaY3mDLVcri",
      {
        "commitment": "finalized"
      }
    ]
  }
'
```

## Definitions

- Hash: A SHA-256 hash of a chunk of data.
- Pubkey: The public key of a Ed25519 key-pair.
- Transaction: A list of Solana instructions signed by a client keypair to
  authorize those actions.
- Signature: An Ed25519 signature of transaction's payload data including
  instructions. This can be used to identify transactions.

## Health Check

Although not a JSON RPC API, a `GET /health` at the RPC HTTP Endpoint provides a
health-check mechanism for use by load balancers or other network
infrastructure. This request will always return a HTTP 200 OK response with a
body of "ok", "behind" or "unknown":

- `ok`: The node is within `HEALTH_CHECK_SLOT_DISTANCE` slots from the latest
  cluster confirmed slot
- `behind { distance }`: The node is behind `distance` slots from the latest
  cluster confirmed slot where `distance > HEALTH_CHECK_SLOT_DISTANCE`
- `unknown`: The node is unable to determine where it stands in relation to the
  cluster

  "method": "getAccountInfo",
  "params": [
    // !hover pubkey

```ts !!request title="Kit"
import { address, createSolanaRpc } from "@solana/kit";

const rpc_url = "https://api.devnet.solana.com";
const rpc = createSolanaRpc(rpc_url);

// !hover pubkey

// !hover pubkey
const publicKey = new PublicKey("vines1vzrYbzLMRdu58ou5XTby4qAqVRLmqo36NKPTg");

console.log("Account Info:", JSON.stringify(accountInfo, null, 2));
```

```rs !!request title="Rust"
use anyhow::Result;
use solana_client::nonblocking::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_commitment_config::CommitmentConfig;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let client = RpcClient::new_with_commitment(
        String::from("https://api.devnet.solana.com"),
        CommitmentConfig::confirmed(),
    );
    let pubkey = Pubkey::from_str("vines1vzrYbzLMRdu58ou5XTby4qAqVRLmqo36NKPTg")?;
    let account = client.get_account(&pubkey).await?;

    println!("{:#?}", account);

    Ok(())
}
```

### !params

#### !! pubkey

!type string
!required

Pubkey of account to query, as base-58 encoded string.

#### !! 1

!type object

Configuration object.

##### !! commitment

!type string

The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. See
[Configuring State Commitment](/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment).

##### !! encoding

!type string
!values base58 base64 base64+zstd binary jsonParsed
!default binary

Encoding format for Account data. See
[Parsed Responses](/docs/rpc#parsed-responses).

- `base58` is slow and limited to less than 129 bytes of Account data.
- `base64` will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size.
- `base64+zstd` compresses the Account data using
  [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result.
- `binary` (⚠️ deprecated) is similar to `base58`, except data will be a base58-encoded string and not an array that includes the encoding.
- `jsonParsed` encoding attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return
  more human-readable and explicit account state data.
- If `jsonParsed` is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls
  back to `base64` encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.

##### !! dataSlice

!type object

Request a slice of the account&apos;s data.

- `length: <usize>` - number of bytes to return
- `offset: <usize>` - byte offset from which to start reading

<Callout type="info">
  Data slicing is only available for `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd`
  encodings.
</Callout>

##### !! minContextSlot

!type string

The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at.

### !!result

```jsonc !response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "context": { "apiVersion": "2.0.15", "slot": 341197053 },
    // !hover(1:8) result
    "value": {
      // !hover data
      "data": ["", "base58"],
      // !hover executable
      "executable": false,
      // !hover lamports
      "lamports": 88849814690250,
      // !hover owner
      "owner": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
      // !hover rentEpoch
      "rentEpoch": 18446744073709551615,
      // !hover space
      "space": 0
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

!type object | null

If the requested account doesn't exist result will be `null`. Otherwise, an
object containing:

#### !! data

!type string | \[string,encoding\] | object

Data associated with the account. Format depends on encoding parameter:
- If the encoding parameter is left as the deprecated default of `binary`, this will be a string containing encoded binary data.
- If `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd` is specified, this will be an array, where the first element is the encoded data string and the second element is the encoding format.
- If `jsonParsed` is specified, this will be JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`.

#### !! executable

!type bool

Boolean indicating if the account contains a program (and is strictly read-only)

#### !! lamports
!type u64

Number of lamports assigned to this account

#### !! owner

!type string

base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to

#### !! rentEpoch

!type u64

The epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as u64

#### !! space

!type u64

The data size of the account

### !params

#### !! 0

!type array
!required

An array of Pubkeys to query, as base-58 encoded strings (up to a maximum
of 100)

#### !! 1

!type object

Configuration object containing the following fields:

##### !! commitment

!type string

The commitment describes how finalized a block is at that point in time. See
[Configuring State Commitment](/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment).

##### !! minContextSlot

!type number

The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at

##### !! dataSlice

!type object

Request a slice of the account's data.

- `length: <usize>` - number of bytes to return
- `offset: <usize>` - byte offset from which to start reading

<Callout type="info">
  Data slicing is only available for `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd`
  encodings.
</Callout>

##### !! encoding

!type string
!values jsonParsed base58 base64 base64+zstd
!default base64

Encoding format for the returned Account data

- `base58` is slow and limited to less than 129 bytes of Account data.
- `base64` will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size.
- `base64+zstd` compresses the Account data using
  [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result.
- `jsonParsed` encoding attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return
  more human-readable and explicit account state data.
- If `jsonParsed` is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls
  back to `base64` encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type
  `<string>`.

##### !! account

!type object

A JSON object containing:

- `lamports: <u64>` - number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64
- `owner: <string>` - base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has
  been assigned to
- `data: <string|[string,encoding]|object>` - data associated with the account. Format depends on encoding parameter:
  - If the encoding parameter is left as the deprecated default of `binary`, this will be a string containing encoded binary data.
  - If `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd` is specified, this will be an array, where the first element is the encoded data string and the second element is the encoding format.
  - If `jsonParsed` is specified, this will be JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`.
- `executable: <bool>` - boolean indicating if the account contains a program
  (and is strictly read-only)
- `rentEpoch: <u64>` - the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as
  u64
- `space: <u64>` - the data size of the account

- `length: <usize>` - number of bytes to return
- `offset: <usize>` - byte offset from which to start reading

<Callout type="info">
  Data slicing is only available for `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd`
  encodings.
</Callout>

##### !! encoding

!values base58 base64 base64+zstd binary jsonParsed
!default binary

Encoding format for Account data

- `base58` is slow and limited to less than 129 bytes of Account data.
- `base64` will return base64 encoded data for Account data of any size.
- `base64+zstd` compresses the Account data using
  [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) and base64-encodes the result.
- `binary` (⚠️ deprecated) is similar to `base58`, except data will be a base58-encoded string and not an array that includes the encoding.
- `jsonParsed` encoding attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return
  more human-readable and explicit account state data.
- If `jsonParsed` is requested but a parser cannot be found, the field falls
  back to `base64` encoding, detectable when the `data` field is type `string`.

!type array

An array of JSON objects containing:

##### !! pubkey

!type string

The account Pubkey as base-58 encoded string

##### !! account

!type object

A JSON object containing:

- `lamports: <u64>` - number of lamports assigned to this account, as a u64
- `owner: <string>` - base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has
  been assigned to
- `data: <string|[string,encoding]|object>` - Token state data associated with the account. Format depends on encoding parameter:
  - If the encoding parameter is left as the deprecated default of `binary`, this will be a string containing encoded binary data.
  - If `base58`, `base64`, or `base64+zstd` is specified, this will be an array, where the first element is the encoded data string and the second element is the encoding format.
  - If `jsonParsed` is specified, this will be JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`.
- `executable: <bool>` - boolean indicating if the account contains a program
  (and is strictly read-only)
- `rentEpoch: <u64>` - the epoch at which this account will next owe rent, as
  u64
- `space: <u64>` - the data size of the account

When the data is requested with the `jsonParsed` encoding a format similar to
that of the [Token Balances Structure](/docs/rpc/json-structures#token-balances)
can be expected inside the structure, both for the `tokenAmount` and the
`delegatedAmount` - with the latter being an optional object.

title: sendTransaction
hideTableOfContents: true
h1: sendTransaction RPC Method
---

Submits a signed transaction to the cluster for processing.

This method does not alter the transaction in any way; it relays the transaction
created by clients to the node as-is.

If the node's rpc service receives the transaction, this method immediately
succeeds, without waiting for any confirmations. A successful response from this
method does not guarantee the transaction is processed or confirmed by the
cluster.

While the rpc service will reasonably retry to submit it, the transaction could
be rejected if transaction's `recent_blockhash` expires before it lands.

Use [`getSignatureStatuses`](/docs/rpc/http/getsignaturestatuses) to ensure a
transaction is processed and confirmed.

Before submitting, the following preflight checks are performed:

1. The transaction signatures are verified
2. The transaction is simulated against the bank slot specified by the preflight
   commitment. On failure an error will be returned. Preflight checks may be
   disabled if desired. It is recommended to specify the same commitment and
   preflight commitment to avoid confusing behavior.

The returned signature is the first signature in the transaction, which is used
to identify the transaction
([transaction id](/docs/references/terminology#transaction-id)). This identifier
can be easily extracted from the transaction data before submission.

### !params

#### !! transaction

!type string
!required

Transaction, as an encoded string.

<Callout type="info">
  The transaction must have a valid blockhash, but is not required to be signed.
</Callout>

#### !! config

!type object
!optional

Configuration object containing the following fields:

##### !! commitment

!type string

Commitment level to simulate the transaction at. See
[Configuring State Commitment](/docs/rpc#configuring-state-commitment).
Default `finalized`.

##### !! encoding

!type string
!values base58 base64
!default base58

Encoding used for the transaction data. Values: `base58` (_slow_,
**DEPRECATED**), or `base64`.


##### !! replaceRecentBlockhash

!type bool
!defaultValue false

If `true` the transaction recent blockhash will be replaced with the most recent
blockhash (conflicts with `sigVerify`)

##### !! sigVerify

!type bool
!defaultValue false

If `true` the transaction signatures will be verified (conflicts with
`replaceRecentBlockhash`)

##### !! minContextSlot

!type number
!optional

The minimum slot that the request can be evaluated at


##### !! innerInstructions

!type bool
!defaultValue false

If `true` the response will include
CPI instructions (`innerInstructions`). These inner
instructions will be `jsonParsed` where possible, otherwise `json`.

##### !! accounts

!type object
!optional

Accounts configuration object containing the following fields:

- `addresses`: An array of accounts to return, as base-58 encoded strings
- `encoding`: Encoding for returned Account data. Note: `jsonParsed` encoding
  attempts to use program-specific state parsers to return more human-readable
  and explicit account state data. If `jsonParsed` is requested but a
  [parser cannot be found](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cfd0a00ae2ba85a6d76757df8b4fa38ed242d185/account-decoder/src/parse_account_data.rs#L98-L100),
  the field falls back to `base64` encoding, detectable when the returned
  `accounts.data` field is type `string`.

### !!result

```jsonc !response

      "unitsConsumed": 1714
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

!type object

The result will contain:

##### !! accounts

!type array|null

Array of accounts with the same length as the `accounts.addresses` array in the
request. Each element is either:

- `null` - if the account doesn't exist or if `err` is not null
- An object containing:
  - `lamports: <u64>` - number of lamports assigned to this account
  - `owner: <string>` - base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has
    been assigned to
  - `data: <[string, encoding]|object>` - data associated with the account,
    either as encoded binary data or JSON format `{<program>: <state>}`
  - `executable: <bool>` - boolean indicating if the account contains a program
  - `rentEpoch: <u64>` - the epoch at which this account will next owe rent

##### !! err

!type object|string|null

Error if transaction failed, null if transaction succeeded. See
[TransactionError definitions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/c0c60386544ec9a9ec7119229f37386d9f070523/sdk/src/transaction/error.rs#L13)

##### !! innerInstructions

!type object|undefined

Defined only if `innerInstructions` was set to `true`. The value is a list of
[inner instructions](/docs/rpc/json-structures#inner-instructions).

##### !! loadedAccountsDataSize

!type u32|undefined

The number of bytes of all accounts loaded by this transaction

##### !! logs

!type array|null

Array of log messages the transaction instructions output during execution, null
if simulation failed before the transaction was able to execute

##### !! replacementBlockhash

!type object|null

The blockhash used to simulate the transaction, containing:

- `blockhash: <string>` - the blockhash used to simulate the transaction
- `lastValidBlockHeight: <u64>` - the last valid block height at which the
  blockhash is valid

##### !! returnData

!type object|null

The most-recent return data generated by an instruction in the transaction,
containing:

- `programId: <string>` - the program that generated the return data, as base-58
  encoded Pubkey
- `data: <[string, encoding]>` - the return data itself, as base-64 encoded
  binary data

##### !! unitsConsumed

!type u64|undefined

The number of compute budget units consumed during the processing of this
transaction

</APIMethod>



## Example Result

- The `JsonParsed` example shows the simulation result for a transaction 
that creates an [associated token account](/docs/tokens/basics/create-token-account#how-to-create-an-associated-token-account).
- The `Json` example shows the simulation result for a transaction with a CPI (`innerInstructions`) that can't be parsed.
